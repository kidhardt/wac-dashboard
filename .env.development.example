# Development Environment Configuration
# Copy this file to .env.development and add your API key

# API Mode: Use proxy server (more secure, keeps API key server-side)
VITE_USE_DIRECT_API=false

# Anthropic API Key (used by server.js proxy)
# Get your API key from: https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys
VITE_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-api-key-here

# Development Notes:
# - Requires running `npm run server` in a separate terminal
# - API calls go through http://localhost:3004/api/chat
# - API key stays on server, not exposed to browser
